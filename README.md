🛠️ Experimental Study to Improve Performance of Compliant Foil Thrust Bearing
An experimental and simulation-based study focused on improving the performance, load-carrying capacity, and stability of compliant foil thrust bearings for high-speed rotating machinery.






🔎 About the Project
Compliant foil thrust bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings offering non-contact, high-speed operation. However, their load-carrying capabilities are limited at lower speeds.
This project explores experimental and simulation methods to enhance the load-carrying capacity, mechanical efficiency, and dynamic stability of compliant foil thrust bearings through design improvements, foil geometry optimization, and the introduction of viscoelastic supports.

🎯 Project Objectives
Improve the load-carrying capacity by varying the number and thickness of foils.
Enhance efficiency by altering foil geometry and sector angles.
Reduce foil deformation using viscoelastic support structures.
Perform FSI (Fluid Structure Interaction) simulations to analyze the stress, pressure, and deformation under varying conditions.
Validate simulation data with experimental results.



✨ Key Features
✅ CAD Models of thrust runners and bearing blocks.
✅ Sector angle optimization for foils (30°, 60°, 90°).
✅ Simulation and analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.0.
✅ Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis with various foil configurations.
✅ Viscoelastic support designs for improved stability and reduced deflection.
